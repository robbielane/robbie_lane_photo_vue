#### [Robbie Lane Photo Vue](http://robbielane.net/robbie_lane_photo_vue/)
*View Project Here*

___
A small and concise [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) application that interacts with my [photography](http://photography.robbielane.me) API to display a single page gallery.

_I really enjoy the simplicity of Vue's API and it makes me look forward to real HTML components_
